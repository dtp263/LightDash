Npm: `npm start`

Yarn: `yarn start`

**The server will be up on the port 8080 by default `localhost:8080`**

Yarn: `yarn run build`

**Your production files should be in a newly created folder name dist**

## :dizzy_face: Adding more functionality to the boilerplate

#### Adding Preprocessors support

Since the boilerplate is using parcel as it's module bundler, you can have sass or any other preprocessor support with one command, simply install the node module for that preprocessor and it will be automatically supported in your project

Sass: `npm install --save-dev node-sass`

Stylus: `npm install --save-dev stylus`

Less: `npm install --save-dev less`
